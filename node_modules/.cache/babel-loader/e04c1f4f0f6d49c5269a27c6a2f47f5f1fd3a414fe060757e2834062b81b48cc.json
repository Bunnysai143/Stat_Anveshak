They help in understanding patterns and changes in continuous data points. A line chart is ideal for comparing multiple datasets over a common axis, such as time, and is effective for analyzing long-term trends, cyclical patterns, and fluctuations.\n      - *Use Cases*: Stock price trends, sales performance, weather patterns, economic indicators.\n      - *Advantages*: Easy to interpret trends, clear representation of changes over time, useful for forecasting.\n      - *Limitations*: Can become cluttered when there are too many lines, not ideal for non-continuous data.\n    `,\n    \"Bar\": `\n      Bar charts are effective for comparing discrete categories or groups. They provide a clear visual representation of the quantity of items in each category. A bar chart is ideal for representing data where the categories are distinct and non-overlapping.\n      - *Use Cases*: Comparing sales figures by region, evaluating the popularity of products, showing demographic breakdowns.\n      - *Advantages*: Easy to compare categories, great for visualizing differences, works well with both small and large datasets.\n      - *Limitations*: Not suitable for continuous data, bars can be misinterpreted if not scaled properly.\n    `,\n    \"Radar\": `\n      Radar charts are used to compare multiple variables across a common baseline. They are particularly effective for evaluating multiple metrics that need to be compared against each other. The chart’s radial layout allows for a visually engaging display of multi-dimensional data.\n      - *Use Cases*: Comparing product features, performance metrics, skills assessment.\n      - *Advantages*: Excellent for showing relative strengths and weaknesses, easy to compare multiple categories at once.\n      - *Limitations*: Can become difficult to read if too many data points are added, not ideal for complex datasets with too many variables.\n    `,\n    \"Doughnut\": `\n      Doughnut charts are similar to pie charts but with a central blank space, making them a more aesthetically pleasing option for displaying parts of a whole. They are useful for showing proportional data but allow for more space in the center for additional information or labels.\n      - *Use Cases*: Market share representation, survey results, budget allocation.\n      - *Advantages*: Visually attractive, great for showing proportions in a compact space, customizable with central labels or percentages.\n      - *Limitations*: Can become unclear with too many slices, difficult to compare small differences between values.\n    `,\n    \"Pie\": `\n      Pie charts are used to represent parts of a whole, typically as percentages of 100%. They are ideal for showing the composition of data in a way that is easily interpretable. However, they should only be used when there are a limited number of categories (typically fewer than 6) for clarity.\n      - *Use Cases*: Showing market share, budget distribution, survey results.\n      - *Advantages*: Simple and intuitive, effective for small numbers of categories.\n      - *Limitations*: Becomes hard to interpret with too many categories, less effective when comparing similar-sized sections.\n    `,\n    \"Scatter\": `\n      Scatter charts are ideal for visualizing the relationship between two continuous variables. They display data points on a two-dimensional axis and can reveal correlations, clusters, and trends.\n      - *Use Cases*: Correlation analysis, relationship between income and age, studying customer behavior.\n      - *Advantages*: Excellent for visualizing correlations, patterns, and outliers in data.\n      - *Limitations*: Cannot be used for categorical data, difficult to interpret with too many data points.\n    `,\n    \"Bubble\": `\n      Bubble charts are an extension of scatter plots that add a third dimension using the size of the bubbles. This allows for more complex data visualization and can represent an additional variable alongside the x and y axes.\n      - *Use Cases*: Financial data analysis (e.g., revenue vs. cost vs. profit), population growth vs. income vs. education levels.\n      - *Advantages*: Allows visualization of three variables in a single chart, great for representing complex datasets.\n      - *Limitations*: Can become crowded with too many data points, requires careful scaling of bubble sizes.\n    `,\n    \"PolarArea\": `\n      Polar Area charts are similar to pie charts but utilize a polar coordinate system. They are ideal for showing quantities of data in relation to different categories on a circular scale. The area of each sector is proportional to the value it represents.\n      - *Use Cases*: Comparing angular data, weather statistics (wind direction vs. speed), directional metrics.\n      - *Advantages*: Effective for displaying cyclic data or quantities that change with angles, visually appealing.\n      - *Limitations*: Can be hard to read with too many categories, not suitable for
